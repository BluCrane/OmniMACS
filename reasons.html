			<h3>Many projects and businesses fail, or fail to reach their full potential, due to inferior, unprofessional or ineffective communication & marketing strategies.</h3>
				<p>This is usually due to a combination of three main reasons:</p>
				<ul>
            				<li><strong>DIY</strong> - Amateurish, inefficient websites and  badly written or unimaginative content will almost certainly have a negative impact on your project, brand or business. Time and energy wasted that should have been spent on your core business, YOUR area of expertise. Trying to save a few bucks can cost you a lot in the long run.</li>
            				<li><strong>Burning money</strong> - There are a number of very expensive agencies out there for those who can afford it. This is not a viable option for most small businesses or individual projects, since it makes basic business sense to keep expenses in line with growth. Splashing out on expensive media services, often an overkill for smaller projects, is a sure way to start your business in the red.</li>
            				<li><strong>Lack of insight</strong> - Invariably the website developers, copywriters or marketing managers you can afford, are specialists only in their specific field, which means you have to pay two or more entities to get the job done. This can work out expensive as well as time consuming. Even more important is the fact that most marketing or communication service providers have no specialised business background. That may translate into inefficient or ineffective media solutions.</li>
