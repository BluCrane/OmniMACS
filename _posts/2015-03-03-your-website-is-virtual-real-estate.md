<h2>Your website is virtual real estate that will reward a proper investment.</h2>
<p>Building and maintaining an effective online presence has become more crucial than ever. 
South Africa's fast growing internet population reached 14 million in 2013, of which 60% accessed the internet regularly from cell phones. 
According to the World Bank every 10% increase in mobile penetration, leads to a corresponding 0.8% increase in gross domestic product, which of course also have big implications for your business.</p>
